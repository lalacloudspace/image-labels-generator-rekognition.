# Image Labels Generator Using Amazon Rekognition üèôÔ∏èüîç

## Overview
This project is part of my **30-Day Cloud Challenge** with **Tech with Lucy (Lucy Wang)**. It demonstrates how to use **Amazon Rekognition** to analyze and label elements in an image.

## Key Features
- Analyze images using **AI** to generate descriptive labels.
- Automate image recognition with **Amazon Rekognition** and the AWS CLI.
- Learn practical cloud and AI skills through hands-on implementation.

## Steps in the Project
1. **Create an Amazon S3 Bucket:** Store the images to be analyzed.
2. **Upload Images:** Used a photo of a busy city as input.
3. **Configure AWS CLI:** Set up the AWS Command Line Interface to interact with AWS services.
4. **Write Python Code:** Implemented the `detect_labels` function to trigger image labeling.
5. **Run the Script:** Successfully labeled the image, identifying a busy city and its elements.

## Tools and Technologies
- **AWS Rekognition**
- **AWS S3**
- **AWS CLI**
- **Python**

## Results
The project successfully labeled a photo of a busy city, identifying objects and elements in the image such as buildings, streets, and vehicles.
